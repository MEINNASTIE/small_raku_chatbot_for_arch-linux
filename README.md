# Raku - personal linux assistant
A small attachable chatbot on screen for my personal use. Can run simple commands for my arch linux environment and do tasks / communicate / etc. 
Keep in mind this works on arch linux! 

#### raku runs on terminal as a command 
`raku`  to activate raku without the need to separately execute it 
*install tkinter beforehead `sudo pacman -S tk`

## notes to self:
- add task management // done
- add more commands (possibility to run more complex combined commands?)
- make it executable and with an shell script 
- introduce a better design solution to overlay Tkinter
